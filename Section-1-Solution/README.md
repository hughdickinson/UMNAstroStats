# Section 1
This repository contains the course materials and the class assignment for Section 1 of AST 5031 and AST 4031.

## Course materials
The course begins with a short introduction to the _Python_ programming language. This `python_intro.pdf` file in this repository contains information to help to get everyone up to speed and (re)familiarized with the basic tools we will be using through the course.

## Assignment
After that you will have to complete the Jupyter Notebook named `Section-1.ipynb` that this repository contains. You should write code to solve the problems it contains, committing your solutions as you go, and pushing the final result back to GitHub.

The notebook itself contains detailed instructions and explains the problems you need to solve.

## Resources
In addition to the Jupyter Notebook, this repository contains a file named `IpacTableFromSource.html` that you will need in order to complete the assigned problems.

The repository also contains a PDF file named `python_intro.pdf` which provides a brief introduction to the _Python_ programming language and the tools that you will be using throughout the course.
